riemapp is a fast, easy-to-use, minimal library for Python 3.7+ that aliases
[manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) 0.16.0+ functions for
visualising animated and intuitive complex mappings (transformations from the
real plane to the comple plane) for various shapes and real-valued functions in
two dimensions. It uses a minimum number of dependencies through
[FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) and
[pangocairo](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango) on Linux.

Users and learners may use riemapp to:

1. Plot (user-defined)
   - Points
   - Lines
   - Triangles
   - Squares
   - Rectangles
   - Other regular polygons
   - Circles
   - Irregular polygons
   - â€¦and so on
2. Create smooth, precise animations for plotted figures and map them on the
   Argand plane according to user-defined complex functions.
3. Save these animations and play them in the default video player available

- Add the `bin` folder to system path.

**pangocairo** (Linux systems)

Install `libpango1.0-dev` if you are on a Linux system -

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install libpango1.0-dev
```

### Install riemapp

`riemapp` uses modern `Python` packaging and can be installed using `pip` -
